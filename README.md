# 🔍 Overview
SASGoal is a fully front-end football statistics platform designed with a focus on clarity, usability, and fast access to information.

The site provides:
- League tables

Unlike multi-sport platforms, SASGoal is dedicated exclusively to football, offering a focused and distraction-free experience.

# 🎨 UI/UX & Design
SASGoal uses a minimal, modern visual style with:
- Dark green — primary branding (inspired by the football field)
- Dark gray / black — dark mode backgrounds
- White / light tones — light mode backgrounds
  
Core UI/UX principles applied:
- Visual consistenc
- Minimalist layout with effective whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy (titles → subtitles → tables)
  
The platform is fully responsive, adapting for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
On smaller screens, the navbar transforms into a hamburger menu, and the search bar becomes a compact search icon.
